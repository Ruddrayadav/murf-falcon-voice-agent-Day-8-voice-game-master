# 🎮 Day 8 — Voice Game Master (Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge)

Welcome to **Day 8** of the **Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge**!  
For this task, I built a fully interactive **voice-controlled D&D-style Game Master** using:

- **LiveKit Agents**
- **Google Gemini**
- **Deepgram STT**
- **Murf Falcon TTS (super fast!)**

This project lets you play a **real-time voice adventure** where the AI Game Master responds dynamically to your actions, maintains story continuity, and guides you through a fantasy world — all through natural speech.
